3. High Scoring words 
Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.
Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.
You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.
If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.
All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

Sample Input:
man i need a taxi up to ubud

Sample Output:
taxi

Program:
import java.util.*;
public class Main
{
    public static String high(String s) {
    return Arrays.stream(s.split(" "))
                .max(Comparator.comparingInt(
                        a -> a.chars().map(i -> i - 96).sum()
                )).get(); 
   }
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    String s;
	    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	    s = sc.nextLine();
		System.out.println(high(s));
	}
}
